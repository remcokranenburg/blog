Welcome to my blog! My name is Remco Kranenburg. I've been working as a software engineer for seven
years at [Crunchr](https://crunchrapps.com). I recently obtained my master's in Computer Science
from VU Amsterdam. I've been selected to work on a
[virtual keyboard for xrdesktop](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5342655141117952) as
