Hi, my name is Remco Kranenburg and I'm a developer. You can reach me via
[email](mailto:remco@burgsoft.nl), or you can comment on one of my blog posts.

I've worked at [Crunchr](https://crunchrapps.com) since 2014 where I've held
many positions, from front-end development to infrastructure to quality
assurance.

I've also worked on
[xrdesktop](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xrdesktop/xrdesktop) as part of
Google Summer of Code 2021, which is the direct cause of this blog. I'd wanted
to work on free software for a while now and this was the perfect introduction.

I plan to continue contributing to various projects and blog about it here!
